This repository contains the approach and strategy used by the RoBorregos team (Tecnológico de Monterrey's robotics team) in the RoboCup 2020 tournament at the RoboCupJunior-RescueMaze category. The code and some parts of the robot are not complete because the tournament was suspended that year by the COVID-19 pandemic.
